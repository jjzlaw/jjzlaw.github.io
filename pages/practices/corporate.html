  				  		<p>Recently, we drafted a comprehensive acquisition agreement for a half- million pounds takeover of an accounting firm. The agreement had to seal all the loopholes not only to protect the client but to avoid any future negligence claims. We had to derive a special schedule as the payment for the purchase was to be made over a five year period but with the added provision that the seller would also get royalty for clients, which stayed on after the sale for a maximum of five years. </p>

  				  	<div class="col-md-6">


  				  		<p> Another interesting feature 

of this agreement was that the debts had to be collected from clients. After intense negotiations it was agreed that any debt collected, which was outstanding after the sale, would be equally divided between the seller and the buyer. Needless to say, a closed provision was added so that all liabilities incurred prior to sale were borne by the seller.
